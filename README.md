## Project Overview

This project leverages the [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) API to work with single-agent reinforcement learning environments. Specifically, it focuses on using the Hopper agent from the MuJoCo environments, with the of training/(teaching?) the Hopper to perform a backflip.
