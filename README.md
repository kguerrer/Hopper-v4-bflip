## Project Overview

This project leverages the [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) API to work with single-agent reinforcement learning environments. Specifically, it focuses on using the Hopper agent from the MuJoCo environments, with the of training/(teaching?) the Hopper to perform a backflip.

The project draws inspiration from and aims to implement the relevant components of the work by **P. Christiano et al.**, as detailed in their paper: ["Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741).
